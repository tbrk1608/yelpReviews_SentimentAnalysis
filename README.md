## Yelp Reviws Text Mining and Analysis:

### About the Repo ....

This project involves the analyses of text data on users’ review of restaurants and sentiment analyses. It is based on a collection of reviews and accompanying star ratings from Yelp. We will examine the effectiveness of different sentiment ‘dictionaries’, and develop and evaluate classification models to help predict sentiment polarity (negative, positive).


To keep the our task manageable, a sample of the original dataset (over 8 million reviews by over a million users for 160K+ businesses) will be used here. The star ratings will be used here to indicate the sentiment label. For binary classification, we will need to convert the 1-5 scale rating values to {positive(1), negative(0)} values.
